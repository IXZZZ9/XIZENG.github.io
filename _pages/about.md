# 👤 About Me

I am a Master's student in Computer Science at [Boston University](https://www.bu.edu/), working as a Research Assistant in [Professor Reza Rawassizadeh's](https://www.bu.edu/cs/profiles/reza-rawassizadeh/) group. My research focuses on efficient training methods for transformers and interpretable medical AI systems, emphasizing practical approaches to improve training efficiency and develop reliable AI applications in healthcare.

Before joining Boston University, I completed my undergraduate studies with a focus on computer science and machine learning applications.
