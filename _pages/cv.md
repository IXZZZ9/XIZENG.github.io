Research Experience
======
* **Research Assistant, Professor Reza Rawassizadeh's Group** (2025 - Present)
  * Boston University
  * Presented weekly reviews of recent publications from leading ML/AI conferences and journals, stimulating group discussion and idea sharing
  * Rapidly implemented prototypes and experimented with novel concepts, reporting findings to guide research direction
  * Led the implementation and experimental design for promising projects (GradES: Significantly Faster Training in Transformers with Gradient-Based Early Stopping, submitted to MLsys)
  * Managed code refactoring, optimization and public release on platforms

* **Research Assistant** (2024 - Present)
  * The Center for Intelligent Medical Electronics, Fudan University
  * Applied statistical methods to determine if experimental data significantly differed from proposed hypotheses in intelligent medical electronics research
  * Utilized Deep Forest algorithm's MDI interpretability to map importance scores and select the most crucial electrodes
  * Compared performance of Deep Forest (as baseline), models using all features, and models trained only on selected important electrodes
  * Demonstrated via statistical analysis that our interpretability approach achieves significant performance gains and enables accuracy with fewer electrodes at lower cost
